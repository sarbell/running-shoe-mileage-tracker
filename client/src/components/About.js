            <p>This app is made to help runners keep track of how many miles have been logged on their shoes. The rule-of-thumb is to replace your running shoes every 300-500 miles. Often, runners will keep running in their shoes until aches and pains start coming, which usually means an injury is already present. Having a tracking site for your shoes will reduce chance of injury, increase awareness of your shoes' life, and provide a fun experience to see all the miles you have run. </p>
