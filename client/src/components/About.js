            <p>This app is made to help runners keep track of how many miles have been logged on their shoes. The rule-of-thumb is to replace them every 300-500 miles. Often, runners will keep on running in their shoes until they start to injure themselves, usually well past the time to replace them. Having a tracking site for your shoes will hopefully reduce chance of injury, while it also fun to see how many miles you have run. </p>
